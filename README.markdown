# Marionette for Unity3D

This is an experimental project that will deal with AI. Specifically artificially intelligent agents and their interaction with each other.

## Usage
Add a component implementing the `IBehavior` interface to a `GameObject`. All necessary dependencies will be added automatically. Marionette changes the `GameObject` to an AI controlled agent.

## Demonstrations
Scenes demonstrating usage are located in the [demonstrations folder](https://github.com/DavidMann10k/Marionette/blob/master/Assets/_scenes/demonstrations).
