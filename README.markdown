# Marionette for Unity3D

This is an experimental project that will deal with AI. Specifically artificially intelligent agents and their interaction with each other.

## Usage
Add a component implementing the `IBehavior` interface to a `GameObject`. All necessary dependencies will be added automatically. Marionette changes the `GameObject` to an AI controlled agent.
